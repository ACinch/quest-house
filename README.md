# Quest House — Neurospicy Household Reset

A Minecraft-themed chore + reward web app for a neurodivergent family of three.
Built with **Next.js 16**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Zustand**, and
**Vercel Blob** for cross-device sync. Per-user login with credentials from
environment variables. Designed to deploy to **Vercel**.

## What it is

A digital companion to a physical chore/reward system. Players (Mom, Maarten,
Winter) earn XP from a sequential **skill tree**, get random **treasure chest
drops**, and convert XP into either weekly **Greenlight cash** (Winter) or
**reward milestones** on an alternating House → Personal cycle (adults).

It is designed around the realities of an ADHD household:

- Short sprint bursts, never marathons
- Stupidly specific tasks (no ambiguity)
- Multiple dopamine layers (XP, money, chests, visual progress)
- **No streaks, no penalties** — missing a day never breaks anything
- **Reskinnable** — Minecraft is the starting theme; the schema separates
  mechanics from flavor so it can be swapped later

See the project specification in this repo's first commit / planning notes for
the full design rationale.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub and import it at
   [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).
2. In the Vercel dashboard for your project, go to **Storage → Create
   Database → Blob**. This provisions a Vercel Blob store and automatically
   adds the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable to your project.
3. Under **Settings → Environment Variables**, add:

   | Variable             | Required | Notes |
   |----------------------|----------|-------|
   | `AUTH_SECRET`        | yes      | Any random string ≥ 16 chars. Used to sign session cookies. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
   | `WINTER_PASSWORD`    | yes      | Winter's login password. |
   | `REBEKAH_PASSWORD`   | yes      | Rebekah's login password. |
   | `MAARTEN_PASSWORD`   | yes      | Maarten's login password. |
   | `WINTER_USERNAME`    | optional | Defaults to `winter`. |
   | `REBEKAH_USERNAME`   | optional | Defaults to `rebekah`. |
   | `MAARTEN_USERNAME`   | optional | Defaults to `maarten`. |

4. Redeploy. The first time anyone visits the app, they'll see a login
   screen — enter the username + password for that family member. Sessions
   are signed httpOnly cookies that last 30 days.

## How auth works

There are exactly **three accounts** — Winter, Rebekah, and Maarten — with
credentials defined in environment variables. There's no signup, no user
table, no password reset flow. To rotate a password, change the env var in
Vercel and redeploy.

- `POST /api/auth/sign-in` — takes `{ username, password }`, validates
  against the env-var pairs (timing-safe comparison), and on success sets a
  HMAC-signed httpOnly session cookie that lasts 30 days.
- `POST /api/auth/sign-out` — clears the session cookie.
- `GET /api/auth/me` — returns the current user (or `null`) and tells the
  client whether the server is configured at all.

The client API in `src/lib/auth-client.ts` deliberately mirrors
[better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)'s React shape:

```ts
import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from "@/lib/auth-client";

const { data: user, isPending } = useSession();
await signIn({ username: "rebekah", password: "..." });
await signOut();
```

This is so we can swap in real better-auth later (once we add a Postgres
database) with minimal call-site changes — the cookie-based sessions, the
sign-in/sign-out flow, and the `useSession()` hook all match its API.

### Why not real better-auth?

Better-auth requires a persistent database (it has `user`, `session`,
`account`, and `verification` tables). With only Vercel Blob in play, there
isn't a good place to put that. Adding Vercel Postgres / Neon would work
and is a clean upgrade path — see "Migrating to better-auth" below.

## How data works

The app has **two layers of persistence**:

1. **Vercel Blob (server)** — the source of truth. A single JSON file
   (`household-state.json`) is read from and written to via two Next.js
   route handlers:
   - `GET /api/state` — returns the current state
   - `PUT /api/state` — overwrites the state
   Both require a valid session cookie (any of the three users).
2. **`localStorage` (browser)** — a working cache, managed by Zustand's
   `persist` middleware. Lets the app render instantly and stay usable
   while offline.

### Sync flow

- On first load, the app calls `GET /api/auth/me`. If there's no session,
  the LoginGate shows a username/password form.
- Once signed in, the sync engine `GET`s the current state from Blob. If
  the server has data, it replaces the local cache. If the server is empty
  (first run), it pushes the local seed up to initialize the household.
- Every change to local state is **debounced 1.5 s** then pushed to Blob.
- The header has a sync indicator (✓ synced, ↻ syncing, ⚠ error, etc.).
  Tap it to manually re-sync.
- **Settings → Sync** has manual Pull / Push buttons. **Settings → Account**
  shows the signed-in user and has a Sign Out button.

### Race conditions

This is a household app — last write wins. If Mom and Winter both edit
state on different devices within ~1.5 s of each other, only the second
write makes it to the server. In practice, this is fine: tasks are
small, mistakes are rare, and the worst case is having to log a chore
twice. If you want stricter merging, you'd need a CRDT or per-user
slices, both of which are overkill for three people in one house.

### Backup / migration

**Settings → Data** still has Export/Import JSON buttons in case you want a
manual backup or want to seed a fresh deployment from an existing one.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

For local dev you need to create a `.env.local` so the LoginGate has
something to validate against:

```
AUTH_SECRET=local-development-secret-at-least-16-chars
WINTER_PASSWORD=winter
REBEKAH_PASSWORD=rebekah
MAARTEN_PASSWORD=maarten
```

If you also want to test cross-device sync against real Vercel Blob, add:

```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_...
```

The easiest way to get a real Blob token locally is:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel link
vercel env pull .env.local
```

Without `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` set, the API returns `503` from `/api/state`
and the sync indicator shows `no blob`. The app still works locally — it
just can't push to or pull from the cloud.

## Migrating to real better-auth

When you're ready for proper user management (signups, password resets,
email verification, multi-factor, OAuth providers, etc.), the migration is:

1. Provision **Vercel Postgres** (Neon) — free tier — from the Storage tab.
2. `npm install better-auth pg`
3. Replace `src/lib/auth.ts` with a `betterAuth({ database, ... })` setup.
4. Replace `src/lib/auth-client.ts` with `createAuthClient(...)` from
   `better-auth/react`. The component-level API (`signIn`, `signOut`,
   `useSession`) is identical.
5. Replace the route handlers under `src/app/api/auth/` with the better-auth
   catch-all handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`.
6. The `/api/state` route already takes the user from a server-side
   session helper; just swap it for `auth.api.getSession({ headers })`.

The household state schema, the sync engine, and every UI component stay
unchanged.

## A note on the in-app user switcher

The header has a Winter / Rebekah / Maarten toggle. This is a **view
switcher**, not an account switcher — it's the lens you're looking through
when you log a task or browse the skill tree. Any signed-in family member
can flip between views (e.g. Rebekah marking off Winter's chores). If you
want to lock down so each account can only act as their own user, that's
a one-line guard in `Dashboard.tsx` and `SkillsView.tsx`.

## Game mechanics

- **5 branches** for Winter, **5+2 shared** for adults (Home Admin and
  Exterior & Seasonal are shared between Mom and Maarten — completing a
  one-off quest closes it for both).
- Skills within a sequential branch unlock when the previous one is
  **mastered** (10 successful completions, configurable).
- Each completed task has a **15% chance** of dropping a treasure chest.
  Boss-level tasks drop guaranteed chests. Mastery, rank ups, and hitting
  the weekly XP cap also trigger chests.
- Winter: weekly XP cap = 100 → $10/week to Greenlight.
- Adults: 500 XP = 1 milestone reward, alternating House → Personal.
- All thresholds, drop rates, and caps live in **Settings**.

## Weekly Boss system

Each week one area of the house becomes a **Minecraft mob** with an
HP bar. The family chips away at it over the course of the week by
completing tasks that deal damage. When HP reaches zero the boss is
defeated — bonus XP for every participant, plus a tiered treasure
chest for Winter.

**Starter bosses:**
- 🟢 Kitchen Creeper (10 tasks, 115 HP)
- 🧟 Living Room Zombie Horde (9 tasks, 95 HP)
- 🟩 Bathroom Slime (7 tasks, 80 HP) — half bath
- 💀 Dining Room Skeleton (6 tasks, 80 HP)
- ☠️ Bonus Room Wither (8 tasks, 120 HP)
- 🐉 Ender Dragon (capstone, ~490 HP — all room bosses combined)

**How it works:**
- A parent picks the week's boss at `/boss/select`, then customizes
  the task list at `/boss/customize` — toggle tasks off that aren't
  relevant this week, add custom one-off tasks, and hit Spawn.
- During the week, family members mark tasks done from `/boss`. Each
  task has a `damage` value (how much HP it removes) and an `xp`
  value (the XP reward to the person who did it — independent of
  damage per spec).
- Winter can't self-confirm: a parent has to tap Done on her behalf.
  The active-view dashboard makes this natural — a parent viewing
  Winter's dashboard tap-and-credits to Winter automatically.
- Completing a zone-matched skill (e.g. `k_mop_kitchen` while the
  Kitchen Creeper is active) **also** deals damage to the boss. The
  skill's normal XP still fires — no double-counting, the damage
  table in `src/lib/data/boss-damage-map.ts` is independent of
  skill XP.
- Any skill with `zone: "any"` (floors, surfaces, waste) damages
  whichever boss is currently active.

**Rewards on defeat:**
- Per-participant damage % decides your chest tier:
  - **Stone** (1–10%) — 5 bonus XP
  - **Iron** (11–25%) — 10 bonus XP
  - **Gold** (26–45%) — 15 bonus XP
  - **Diamond** (46–70%) — 25 bonus XP
  - **Netherite** (71%+) — 40 bonus XP
- Adults get **bonus XP only**.
- Winter also gets a tiered **chest drop** into her inventory,
  drawn from `DEFAULT_WINTER_CHEST_POOL` at the matching tier.
- Winter's bonus XP **bypasses the weekly cap** for the dollar
  calculation — every bonus XP always converts to Greenlight
  money, even if her regular weekly XP is already at 100.
- Any participation >0 floors to Stone tier — even one small task
  on a huge boss is rewarded.

**Weekly rollover:**
- Undefeated bosses at week end **despawn** by default (logged as
  expired, no rewards). Set `carryOverUndefeated: true` in
  Settings → Bosses to keep fights going week-to-week.
- In rotate mode, the store auto-picks the next boss from the
  rotation order into `"spawning"` state. A parent still has to
  finish setup and hit Spawn.

## Customization

- **Custom Quests** (Settings → Custom Quests) — add new "adulting" tasks to
  the Home Admin or Exterior branches at any time. They appear in both
  adults' skill trees automatically.
- **Chest Pool** (Settings → Chest Pool) — edit the slips that get drawn
  when a chest drops, per user.
- **Bosses** (Settings → Bosses) — selection mode (manual / rotate),
  carry-over behavior, enable/disable the feature entirely, and
  manual reset for the active boss.
- **Weekend Reset Level** (Settings) — Level 1 (20–30 min) → Level 2
  (40–50 min) → Level 3 (60–90 min). Start small, level up when ready.
- **Theme** — currently only Minecraft. The skill tree structure is
  theme-agnostic; future themes can override colors, fonts, and flavor text.
